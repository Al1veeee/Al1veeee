### 👋 About me
Hi, I’m Deni — a 3rd-year Software & Systems Engineering student at RTU MIREA, based in Moscow, Russia.
I’m a junior Android developer focused on Kotlin and modern Android tools, and I prefer to learn by building real things, not just reading documentation.

---

### ☕ Right now
- Exploring Jetpack Compose and trying to make UI feel simple and pleasant to use.
- Working with Coroutines and Flow to keep async work and state under control.
- Using Retrofit/OkHttp, Room, and Hilt in pet projects to get closer to “real world” Android apps.

---

### ✨ How I work
- I prefer clear, readable code over “smart” one-liners.
- I like steady daily progress instead of rushing and burning out.
- I treat feedback as a normal part of the process, not as something negative.
- I try to keep my repos tidy: meaningful commits, short notes, and up-to-date README.

---

### 🏃 Beyond coding
Outside of tech, I enjoy PC games, mostly as a way to relax and reset.  
At the same time, I try to keep gaming in check so it doesn’t take over my schedule.  
I care about a healthy lifestyle, lean towards a sporty routine, and stay away from bad habits — it helps me keep focus and energy for learning and projects.

---

### 💼 Open to
Even though I’m still studying, I’m open to junior roles and internships — on-site in Moscow or remote.
I’m ready to learn fast, adapt to the team’s stack, and grow through real tasks and feedback.
